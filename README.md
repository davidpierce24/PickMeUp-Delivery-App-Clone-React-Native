# PickMeUp - a Door Dash, Uber Eats, Deliveroo clone built in React Native

This is my first try at cross-platform development. React Native has been super fun to learn, and UI's can be implemented so smoothly with Tailwind CSS. This was also my first experience with Redux, and it is a huge help with state management. Thanks to Sonny Sangha for the instruction!

## Tools Used

- React Native
- JavasScript
- Redux
- Tailwind CSS
- Sanity.io
- Expo

### Future additions
- Implement the full search feature for various restaurants
- Set up location services to have the current location features fully functioning
